    <p> 
        The <b>Beagle</b> is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The <b>beagle</b> was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the <b>beagle</b> is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The <b>beagle</b> is intelligent and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.
